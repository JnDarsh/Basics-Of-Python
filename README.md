Basics of Python

# 🎯 Aim
To study basics of python instructions.

# 🛠️ Tools Required
Code Editor / IDE such as:
VS Code
PyCharm
IDLE (Python default editor)
Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

# 📖 Theory
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It is widely used due to its simple syntax and readability, which makes it ideal for beginners.
Python does not require compilation and executes programs line by line, which helps in easy debugging. It supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

In this project, the following basic Python concepts are covered:
Variables and data types
Input and output functions
Arithmetic operators
Conditional statements

Simple mathematical programs such as:
Sum and average of numbers
Area and perimeter of geometric shapes
Simple calculator

These programs help learners understand how Python works and how logic is applied in programming.

# Applicatons
Python is a versatile language and is used in many fields:
Web Development – frameworks like Django and Flask
Data Science – data analysis and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning – TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
Automation / Scripting – writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks
Game Development – using libraries like Pygame
Software Development – backend services and applications
Education – teaching programming concepts due to its simple syntax

Even learning the basics of Python gives a strong foundation for any of these advanced fields.


# ✅ Conclusion
Python is an easy and powerful programming language suitable for beginners. Learning the basics of Python helps in building a strong foundation for advanced programming concepts. Through this project, basic syntax and logic building skills are developed, which are essential for further learning in areas like web development, data science, and artificial intelligence.
